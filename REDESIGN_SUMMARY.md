# Site Redesign Summary

## What Was Done

Your personal site has been completely redesigned to position you as a thought leader in agentic systems engineering. The old "Staff Engineer | Tech Leader | AI Enthusiast" tagline has been replaced with bold, compelling positioning that reflects your actual expertise.

## Key Changes

### 1. **Hero Section**
- **New positioning**: "I build the infrastructure that makes AI agents actually work in production."
- Clean, bold typography with your credentials front and center
- Two clear CTAs: "Let's Talk" and "See What I Build"

### 2. **The Story Section**
- Tasteful telling of the "cult leader" → proved right narrative
- Highlights: AI Office Hours, task forces, hybrid RAG system, Testing Maturity Model
- Emphasizes you're not a "prompt engineer" but a platform architect
- Credentials showcase: M.S., B.S. dual degrees, Staff Engineer at Justworks, ClassPass success

### 3. **What I Build Section**
- **33GOD** featured prominently with technical details (Yi, Flume, Bloodbank)
- **Intelliforia** healthcare AI platform
- **GOD Docs** documentation infrastructure
- **Common Project Framework** consulting methodology
- Each project has tech badges and descriptions that position them as production-grade systems

### 4. **Writing & Thinking**
- Links to Substack and Medium
- Positioned as "ideas worth spreading"
- Clean, simple design that encourages clicks

### 5. **Open Source**
- Grid of your key repos: 33GOD components, did-stuff, prompt-and-tag
- Direct links to GitHub

### 6. **Contact Section**
- **Headline**: "Need someone who can actually build this?"
- Professional copy targeting VPs of Engineering
- Multiple contact methods: email, LinkedIn, GitHub
- Social links: Twitter, Mastodon, Substack

## Design Features

- **Dark mode** with sophisticated color palette
- **Modern typography**: Inter for body text, JetBrains Mono for code/tech
- **Smooth animations**: Parallax hero, fade-in sections, staggered card animations
- **Fully responsive**: Looks great on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **No template bloat**: Custom HTML/CSS/JS, no frameworks

## Technical Details

- **Static site**: Pure HTML/CSS/JS, no build process
- **No Jekyll**: Added `.nojekyll` file to disable Jekyll processing
- **Fast loading**: Minimal dependencies (just Google Fonts)
- **GitHub Pages ready**: Just push to deploy

## Files Created/Modified

```
✓ index.html (new)           - Main site
✓ assets/css/main.css (new)  - All styling
✓ assets/js/main.js (new)    - Smooth scrolling + animations
✓ .nojekyll (new)            - Disable Jekyll
✓ README.md (modified)       - Updated for the new site
✓ README.old.md (backup)     - Your old README saved
```

## What's Committed (NOT Pushed)

All changes are committed to your local `main` branch with this message:

```
Complete site redesign: Position as agentic systems thought leader

- Replace generic 'AI Enthusiast' tagline with bold positioning statement
- Add compelling narrative: 'cult leader' → proved right story arc
- Showcase production systems: 33GOD, Intelliforia, GOD Docs
- Modern dark-mode design with clean typography
- Professional contact section targeting VPs of Engineering
- Static HTML/CSS/JS (no template bloat)
- Remove Jekyll dependency with .nojekyll

Built with intention, not templates.
```

## Next Steps

1. **Review the site**: Open `index.html` in your browser to see it locally
2. **Make any adjustments**: Edit the files as needed
3. **Push when ready**: 
   ```bash
   cd ~/code/delorenj.github.io
   git push origin main
   ```
4. **GitHub Pages will deploy automatically** (usually takes 1-2 minutes)

## What Makes This Work

This isn't just a prettier site—it's strategic positioning:

1. **No ambiguity**: You build production AI infrastructure, not demos
2. **Social proof**: The "cult leader" story shows you were ahead of the curve
3. **Technical depth**: 33GOD details show you're the real deal
4. **Clear CTA**: VPs of Engineering know exactly why they should contact you

The site makes someone think: "I need to talk to this person."
